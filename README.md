# Code-Quiz 
## Description
The main objective of this project was to create a quiz from scratch for using Javascript for the user to interact with. 

From this project I have been able to develop a lot, in terms of understanding how local storage works, how to use click events and the DOM to create interactive user experiences. 
A lot of problems I encountered specifically, when it came to storing the highscore in local storage and retriving it back, but working through the steps logically and testing to see the output I get based 
on my logic really worked, thus I was able to vastly improve my ability to logically and critically code, this helped me understand better based on the code I set the output I recieve, and to reverse engineer and solve my problems based on the output.
