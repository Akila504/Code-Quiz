# Code-Quiz 
## Description
The main objective of this project was to create a quiz from scratch for using Javascript for the user to interact with. 

The reason for doing this project was to consolidate all the teachings of Javascript thus far from functions, loops, arrays, objects, timers, the document object model, query selectors and local storage to create this interactive project. 

From this project I have been able to develop a lot, in terms of understanding how local storage works, how to use click events and the DOM to create interactive user experiences. 
A lot of problems I encountered specifically, when it came to storing the highscore in local storage and retriving it back, but working through the steps logically and testing to see the output I get based 
on my logic really worked, thus I was able to vastly improve my ability to logically and critically code. This helped me to better understand the output I was reciving based on the code and logic I set, therefore I was able to reverse engineer and solve my problems based on the output.
